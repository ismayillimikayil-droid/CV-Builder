# Instructions for Database Setup

You have successfully configured the application to use Supabase. To make the "Save" and "Load" buttons work, you must create a table in your Supabase database.

## 1. Login to Supabase
Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ncvozshliunrfqsslpld)

## 2. Open SQL Editor
Navigate to the SQL Editor tab on the left sidebar.

## 3. Run this SQL Command
Copy and paste the following code into the editor and click "Run":

```sql
-- Create the table
create table resumes (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  content jsonb,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Enable RLS (Row Level Security)
alter table resumes enable row level security;

-- Create a policy to allow anyone to read/write (for this demo)
create policy "Enable all access"
on resumes for all
using (true)
with check (true);
```

Once this is run, your Resume Builder will successfully save to the cloud!
